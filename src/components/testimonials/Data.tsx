      "I had the privilege of working with Tshimangadzo on our final year Capstone Project that entailed the design and implementation of an online store with the ability to purchase car parts from the system. He is very dedicated and was extremely easy to work with. He has a passion and a drive to get things done. I would happily work with him again if given the chance as I think he has the adaptability to mesh well in healthy working environments.",
